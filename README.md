# The Game of Life

Write the functions described in `exercise.py` (many are already written; look
for the TODO lines).

The goal of this homework is writing a new version of the key functions *without
using loops*, but using instead numpy vectorization.

You can see the animation by running: `python exercise.py` (even before you
solve the exercise).

You can test your solution locally by running: `python -m doctest exercise.py`
